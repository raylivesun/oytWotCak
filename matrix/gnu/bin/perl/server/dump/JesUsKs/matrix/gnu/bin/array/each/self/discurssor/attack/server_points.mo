 where , , and represent volumetric flow terms (i.e., each has units of ). 
 In general, this equation does not qualify as a conservation equation because 
 volume is (again, in general) not conserved. However, if we know that each 
 of these flows is an incompressible fluid, then we can multiply the entire 
 equation by the density of that incompressible fluid, i.e.,
