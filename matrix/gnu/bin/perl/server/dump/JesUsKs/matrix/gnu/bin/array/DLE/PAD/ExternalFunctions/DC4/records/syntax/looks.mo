/*
SyntaxÂ¶

The record definition looks essentially like a model definition, but without 
any equations:

As with a model, the definition starts and ends with the name of the record 
being defined. An explanation of the record can be included as a string after 
the name. All the variables associated with the record are declared within the 
record definition.

The following are all examples of record definitions:
*/

record RecordName "Description of the record"
  // Declarations for record variables
end RecordName;
