Now each of these terms has units of

which is a conservation equation because mass is a conserved quantity. However, 
if you use this connector definition with a fluid that has any significant degree 
of compressibility, you will get the wrong answer.

Such a connector definition is useful for relatively simple incompressible fluid 
flow networks because it can frequently describe the behavior of the system without 
having to specify (or know) the density of the working fluid. However, this kind of 
approach is inherently limiting so it should only be used in situations where it 
solves more problems than it creates.
