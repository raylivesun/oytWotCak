EventsÂ¶

In the first chapter on Basic Equations we saw examples of how to describe 
continuous behavior. The equations introduced in that chapter applied at all 
times and the solutions to those equations were always continuous. In this 
chapter, we discussed the various ways in Modelica to describe discrete behavior. 
Events are the root cause of all discrete behavior in Modelica.
