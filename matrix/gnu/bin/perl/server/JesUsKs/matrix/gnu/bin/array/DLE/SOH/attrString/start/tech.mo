/*
start

    Technically, a String could be chosen as a state variable (or even an 
    iteration variable), but in practice this never happens. So for a String 
    variable the only practical use of the start attribute is to define the 
    value of a parameter (that happens to have the type of String) if no 
    explicit value for the parameter is given.

    Default: ""

    Type: String

It is worth noting that Derived Types retain the attributes of the built-in

example, the min attribute on a Real variable is listed having the type Real 
it should be pointed out explicitly that attributes cannot themselves have 
attributes. In other words, the start attribute doesnâ€™t have a start 
attribute.
