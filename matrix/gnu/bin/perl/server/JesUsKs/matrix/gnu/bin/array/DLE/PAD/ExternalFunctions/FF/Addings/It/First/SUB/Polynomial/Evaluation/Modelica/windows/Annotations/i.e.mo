Annotations

An annotation is a piece of metadata that doesn’t describe the behavior of the 
function directly (i.e., it doesn’t affect the value the function returns). 
Instead, annotations are used by Modelica compilers to give them “hints” 
about how to deal with certain situations. Annotations are always “optional” 
information which means tools are not required to use the information when 
provided. The Modelica specification defines a number of standard annotations 
so that they are interpreted consistently across Modelica tools.
